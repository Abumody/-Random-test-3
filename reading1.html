<h3 style="text-align:center;">Traditional Medicine</h3>

<p>
Despite the remarkable progress in medical technology and drug industry, some people still do not like going to hospitals for treatment. In the past decade, there has been renewed attention and interest in the use of traditional medicine (TM) globally. Natural products and traditional medicine have been used for centuries in many parts of the world. Some traditional medicine, like Chinese medicine, Ayurveda in India, Kampo in Japan, and Korean medicine, have become well-established systems of healthcare. However, is traditional medicine a good thing?
</p>

<p>
Supporters of traditional medicine would argue that its history has had a deep impact on human health for centuries. Traditional medicine originated in China around 3000 years ago and spread to Korea and Japan with the influence of Chinese culture starting in the 6th century. In China, Western medicine made its initial appearance in the 16th century, but it did not gain widespread popularity until the 19th century. Before that, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) was the primary healthcare system. TCM has developed specific techniques for things like the right amount to use, how to prepare and process materials, and the best time to collect plant parts for medicine. It is interesting that TCM is becoming more similar to modern medicine. It accounts for around 40% of all health care delivered.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, it has been claimed that traditional medicine doctors are not different from any medical school doctors. For example, in China, Korea, and Japan, TM doctors are defined by law, and their activities are controlled by the government. A five-year course in TM is a must in China’s universities while in Korea a six-year program offered by eleven private universities. In medical facilities like hospitals and clinics, Korea had the highest percentage of traditional medicine (TM) doctors at 15.26%, followed by China at 12.63%. In the case of Japan, the new law of medicine forces students to study TM after studying modern medicine first which makes it harder for students to go for another five years studying TM course. As a result, only 0.65% of doctors, who are also members of a non-governmental academic society called the Japan Society for Oriental Medicine, practiced Kampo in 2008.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, critics of traditional medicine claim that like any other medicine, TM also has some side effects. Herbal medicine can cause kidney failure and liver damage in some cases because they contain toxic chemicals. In 1999, a 34-year-old Australian woman was found dead in her house for drinking herbal tea to lose weight. After investigation, it was found that her herbal tea contained an excessive level of lead, which caused severe poisoning and led to death.
</p>

<p>
Besides, many herbal products did not have any warning labels about ingredients, side effects, and drug interactions. Therefore, Australia has issued a new rule to prevent selling any herbal products without warning labels.
</p>

<p>
So is traditional medicine better or not? Perhaps it all depends on how the individual manages the medicine itself. It is undoubtful that TM has many benefits but we cannot ignore the need for modern medicine and its theories.
