                <h2>Vacation Story</h2>
                <div class="story-text">
                    <p>My most memorable vacation was during the summer of 2007 when I went to visit my grandparents who live in Rhode Island. From Virginia, my homeland, the drive by car took eleven hours. It was a tiring journey but when we arrived, we were welcomed by a wonderful, home-cooked seafood meal. Extremely tired from the drive, we slept late Sunday.</p>
                    
                    <p>On Monday, my grandfather took us on a sailing trip. I felt very thrilled as I got into my grandfather's old boat. The view of the sea was stunning. For almost an hour, we enjoyed fishing. Luckily, we all caught something that day. We caught "striped bass" (which can be found in either fresh or salt water) and "blue fish". My striped bass weighed twenty-eight pounds and was forty-eight inches long. I felt very proud having caught this huge fish!</p>
                    
                    <p>On Tuesday, we went to New York city using a subway train and arrived there at 6:00 am to go on a sightseeing tour around the city by bus. However, our tour was delayed because the bus was half an hour late. During the tour, we saw Ground Zero, the Empire State Building, and the Statue of Liberty. After the tour, we had dinner in Central Park, at a restaurant called the Boat House which had the best crab ever.</p>
                    
                    <p>On Wednesday, we drove to Newport and toured Astors' House. Astors' House is a historical place in which a very rich man called Mr. William B. Astor lived with his wife. It was very interesting to see how rich people lived many years ago. After that trip, we ate at a very expensive restaurant, Castle Hill. To be honest, I didn't like the food, but my mother couldn't stop eating; she seemed to enjoy it.</p>
                    
                    <p>On Thursday, which was my favourite day, we went to Boston. Early that morning, Boston Harbor Cruises took us on a whale-watching trip. It was literally breathtaking watching these exotic creatures. While we were getting out of the luxurious yacht, we saw the greatest invention ever: a seven-seater bike! I insisted on trying that bike, but my sister was afraid to try it out. So, we missed that thrilling adventure. Although I thought that I wanted to study either human biology or soil biology, my time in Boston helped me to realize that what I really want is to study Marine Biology.</p>
